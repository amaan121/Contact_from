1.Create Files: Save your HTML content in an .html file and your PHP code in a .php file.

2.HTML Link: In your HTML file, use the anchor <a> tag to create a link. Set the href attribute to the path of your PHP file. Example: <a href="myfile.php">Click here</a>.

3.Web Server: Ensure both files are in the same directory and hosted on a web server with PHP support. Local development servers like XAMPP or WAMP can be used.

4.Access PHP Content: In the PHP file, you can embed dynamic content within HTML using <?php ?> tags. For instance, you can fetch data from a database and display it.

5.Interaction: The HTML link directs users to the PHP file when clicked. PHP processes server-side logic and generates dynamic content, which is then presented in the user's browser.

6.Display: Open your HTML file in a web browser, and when the link is clicked, it triggers the PHP file's execution, and the generated content is displayed on the HTML page.

7.Remember to check your file paths and ensure proper server configuration to ensure the HTML and PHP files communicate effectively.
